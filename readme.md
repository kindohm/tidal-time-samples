This is an outline of techniques and features you can use with the TidalCycles
live-coding environment to work with rhythmic or "time-constrained" audio
samples.

## What is a Time-Constrained Sample?

A time-constrained sample can be a sample that:

- has a specific duration
- has a tempo-specific rhythm that lasts multiple beats

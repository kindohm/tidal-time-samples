Time-Constrained Samples in TidalCycles
=======================================

> Prepared for a TidalCycles workshop at the 2nd International Conference on
> Live Coding, 2016-10-12, Hamilton, ON, Canada.

This is an outline of techniques and features you can use with the TidalCycles
live-coding environment to work with rhythmic or "time-constrained" audio
samples.

## What is a Time-Constrained Sample?

A time-constrained sample can be a sample that:

- has a specific duration
- has a tempo-specific rhythm that lasts multiple beats

## notes

### basic triggering at bps

### long loops  

#### striate

#### loopAt

### short samples

#### unit and speed synth params

#### begin and end variation

#### other synth param variation

### re-sampling
